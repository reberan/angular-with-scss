  <h2>5. Database Queries</h2>
  <p>
    QueryDSL is used so that database queries can be written in a type-safe
    language (and not simply as native string SQL expressions). So that all
    database queries of a domain are not scattered everywhere in the code
  </p>

  <pre> class AnimalPredicate </pre>
  <pre> class ZooPredicate </pre>

  <p>
    The QAnimal and QZoo classes are automatically generated to have the fields
    available for the queries. Since our repositories are derived from
    WmsGenericRepository&lt;T, ID&gt;, as mentioned above, and this in turn uses
    the QueryDslPredicateExecutor&lt;T&gt; interface, we have all these database
    query options at our disposal. The generation of the files is triggered by
    Eclipse → Maven → Update Project (or in IntelliJ right-click on project
    folder → Maven → Generate Sources and Update Project).

  <pre>
public interface WmsGenericRepository&lt;T, ID extends Serializable>
extends JpaRepository&lt;T, ID&gt;, QueryDslPredicateExecutor&lt;T&gt; ...</pre

    I won't go into the details here, but I'll briefly explain what each method
    does. The BooleanExpression isSpecies(String species) method returns an
    expression that checks whether the species field contains the given string.
    The % signs are wildcards for Oracle SQL queries. This is not solved very
    nicely in this example. Ideally, wildcards are always identified with e.g. *
    and the logic then converts this into the correct syntax depending on the
    database. The BooleanExpression isFromCountry(String country) method returns
    an expression that checks the country field for equality with the passed
    string.
