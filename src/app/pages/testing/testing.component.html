  <h2>8. Testing</h2>
  <h3>8.1 Unit test</h3>
  <p>
    For general testing, see
    <a href="https://wiki.sswdev.stoecklin.com/display/SOFT/Unit+Testing"
      >Tips&Tricks</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    The updating of the schema is controlled in the same way as the
    <a
      href="https://wiki.sswdev.stoecklin.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=18055561"
      >core configuration</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the Data <i>test-config-wms-database.xml</i> file is relevant here.
    The value for hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto should be set to at least
    <i>update</i>. To ensure that both the schema is up-to-date and that there
    is no legacy data, the <i>create</i> value is optimal.
  </p>
  <p>
    The test is run with DB user itest. This is also configured in the
    <b> test-config-wms-database.xml </b>
    file.
  </p>

  <p>
    The beans for the services must also be made available through
    configuration. The procedure here is analogous to the core configuration.
  </p>

  <pre> class ZooAnimalLocalServicesIT </pre>

  <p>The remote services could now also be tested in a similar way.</p>

  <h3>8.2 Logging dialog</h3>
  <p>
    The RemoteService are injected with the help of Spring and can then be used
    where desired. Attached is a dialog version to illustrate the integration of
    the remote services into the application. This type must not be used for
    test purposes. Only unit and integration tests, which can be run regularly
    and automatically, are used for tests.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this <i>quick-and-dirty</i> testing, a <i>LogTestDialog</i> was added
    using Swing under the help menu, which displays the log data.
  </p>

  <pre> class LogTestDialog </pre>

  <p>
    The calling action is defined below and is registered as a bean using Spring
    in the <b>masterconsole.xml</b> configuration file.
  </p>

  <pre> class LogTestAction</pre>

  <p>Entries in <b> masterconsole.xml </b></p>

  <pre> masterconsole.xml </pre>

  Attached is the start of the log display.
