  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This document describes a simple example of entities that are persisted and
    to which services and remote services are made available. The basic
    functionality of Spring regarding IoC (Inversion of Control) and persistence
    with the help of Hibernate and JPA is assumed as a basis. You should also be
    familiar with SQL statements.
